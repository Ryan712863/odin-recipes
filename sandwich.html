<h1>Sandwich Recipe</h1>
<h3>Description: </h3>
<p>To make a classic sandwich, begin by selecting two slices of your preferred bread, 
    such as whole grain, sourdough, or rye. Spread your choice of condiments—like mayonnaise, 
    mustard, or hummus—onto one or both slices to add flavor and moisture. Next, layer on your 
    protein, such as sliced turkey, ham, chicken, or a plant-based alternative, ensuring even 
    coverage. Add a slice or two of cheese if desired, followed by fresh vegetables like lettuce,
     tomato slices, cucumbers, or onions for added crunch and nutrition. Top with the second slice
      of bread, press down gently to hold everything together, and cut the sandwich in half if preferred.
       For a warm variation, you can grill the assembled sandwich in a skillet until the bread is golden brown
        and the cheese is melted. Enjoy your homemade sandwich!</p>
