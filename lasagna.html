    <h1>Lasagna recipe</h1>
    <h3>Description: </h3>
    <p>To make a classic homemade lasagna, start by preparing the meat sauce: in a 
        large skillet over medium heat, cook 1 pound of ground beef and ½ pound of 
        Italian sausage until browned; drain excess fat, then add 1 diced onion and 
        2 minced garlic cloves, cooking until the onion is translucent. Stir in a 36-ounce 
        jar of pasta sauce, 2 tablespoons of tomato paste, 1 teaspoon of Italian seasoning, 
        ½ teaspoon of salt, and ¼ teaspoon of black pepper; let the sauce simmer uncovered 
        for about 5 minutes to thicken. While the sauce simmers, bring a large pot of salted 
        water to a boil and cook 12 lasagna noodles until al dente according to package directions; 
        drain and rinse them under cold water to prevent sticking. In a medium bowl, combine 2 cups 
        of ricotta cheese, ¼ cup of chopped fresh parsley, 1 beaten egg, 1½ cups of shredded mozzarella
         cheese, and ¼ cup of grated Parmesan cheese; mix well and season with ¼ teaspoon of salt. Preheat 
         your oven to 350°F (175°C). In a 13-inch baking dish, spread 1 cup of the meat sauce on the bottom. 
         Place 3 lasagna noodles over the sauce, then spread ⅓ of the ricotta cheese mixture over the noodles, 
         followed by 1 cup of meat sauce. Repeat this layering process two more times, ending with a layer of noodles 
         topped with the remaining meat sauce. Sprinkle the top with the remaining 2½ cups of mozzarella cheese and ¼ 
         cup of Parmesan cheese. Cover the dish with aluminum foil and bake for 45 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for 
         an additional 15 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly. For a golden top, you can broil the lasagna for 3
          minutes at the end. Allow the lasagna to rest for at least 15 minutes before serving to help it set and make slicing easier.
           Enjoy your homemade lasagna with a side of garlic bread and a fresh salad for a complete meal!</p>
