<h1>Taco Recipe</h1>
<h3>Description: </h3>
<p>To make classic ground beef tacos, start by heating a tablespoon of olive oil 
    in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add one pound of lean ground beef and cook 
    until browned, breaking it up with a spoon as it cooks. Drain any excess fat, then 
    stir in two teaspoons each of chili powder and cumin, half a teaspoon each of oregano, 
    garlic powder, salt, and black pepper, along with two tablespoons of tomato paste and 
    half a cup of water. Let the mixture simmer for 4 minutes until the sauce thickens.
     While the meat simmers, warm 8 corn or flour tortillas in a skillet or microwave. 
     To assemble the tacos, spoon the seasoned beef onto each tortilla and top with your 
     favorite ingredients such as shredded lettuce, diced tomatoes, chopped red onions, 
     shredded cheese, sour cream, guacamole, or salsa. Serve immediately and enjoy your 
     homemade tacos!</p>
